# Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction System Wiki

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end MLOps solution designed to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. It demonstrates a complete production pipeline, from model training to deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A Django-based web application for easy data entry.
- **High-Performance Backend**: FastAPI microservice for real-time model inference.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Deployed on Kubernetes (Minikube) with auto-scaling capabilities.
- **Robust Monitoring**: Integrated Prometheus and Grafana for system observability.
- **Automated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
