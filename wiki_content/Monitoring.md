# Monitoring and Observability

The Heart Disease Prediction System includes a comprehensive monitoring stack based on Prometheus and Grafana.

## Monitoring Components

### 1. Prometheus UI
Prometheus is responsible for scraping metrics from the production API and storing them for analysis.
- **Endpoint**: `/prometheus`
- **Features**: Real-time metric querying, system health checks, and alerting rules.

### 2. Grafana Dashboard
Grafana provides a visual interface for the metrics collected by Prometheus.
- **Endpoint**: `/grafana`
- **Dashboards**: Features a dedicated "Heart Disease API Metrics" dashboard showing:
    - **Total Requests**: Number of predictions made.
    - **Success Rate**: Ratio of successful vs failed predictions.
    - **Latency**: 95th and 99th percentile response times.

## How to Access
Once the system is deployed, the monitoring tools are available at:
`http://heart-disease-2024ab05112.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/grafana/`
`http://heart-disease-2024ab05112.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/prometheus/`

## Metrics Customization
Metrics are generated using the `prometheus_client` library in the Backend FastAPI service. The key metrics tracked are:
- `http_requests_total`: A counter for every hit to the prediction endpoint.
- `http_request_duration_seconds`: A histogram of request processing times.

All metrics are exposed at the internal endpoint `/api/metrics` which is scraped by Prometheus every 15 seconds.
